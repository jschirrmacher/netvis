It uses the famous https://d3js.org/ library's force diagram and adds a couple of
functions to make it ease to use it with json formatted data, which might be
static (from a simple file) or could be created dynamically by a server program.

Features:

- Can show different types of nodes: circle or rectangle
- Optimized for large networks by letting the user click on the nodes to hide or show the connections of the node
- Can create new or delete existing nodes and connections with event handlers for easy backend attachment
- Can show node details on demand
- Draggable and zoomable canvas, draggable nodes
- Programmable zoom (e.g. for screen buttons)
- Written completely in ES6
